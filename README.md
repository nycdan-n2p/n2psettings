## The Concierge — AI Onboarding Agent

The Concierge is an AI-powered conversational onboarding agent that guides new accounts through the entire setup process. It uses Anthropic Claude via SSE streaming and calls the same MCP tools the settings UI uses — so every step results in real data written to the net2phone backend.

### Onboarding Stages

| # | Stage key | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `welcome_scrape` | Collects admin name + website URL; Claude scrapes the website to extract company name, hours, timezone, phone numbers, and description |
| 2 | `verification_holidays` | Admin reviews and corrects scraped data; optionally auto-loads national holidays |
| 3 | `cdr_analysis` | *(Optional)* Admin uploads a CDR CSV; a dedicated Claude agent analyzes it to extract users, extensions, numbers, call patterns, and recommends ring group / call queue / after-hours configuration |
| 4 | `porting` | Multi-step porting wizard: select numbers, enter current provider details, submit contact/billing address, receive LOA signing link |
| 5 | `user_ingestion` | Add team members manually or upload a CSV; live email validation against the net2phone account prevents duplicate users |
| 6 | `architecture_hardware` | Sequential sub-steps: define departments → assign users → choose phone type → configure hardphone details and MAC addresses |
| 7 | `licensing` | Comprehensive call routing setup: welcome menu (greeting, TTS, menu options, extension dialing, barge, hold message) → ring group or call queue (strategy, tiers, rings, schedule) → after-hours configuration |
| 8 | `final_blueprint` | Markdown summary of the full configuration; one-click "Confirm & Build" applies everything via MCP tools with a live step-by-step progress display |

### Key Technical Details

- **AI loop:** `hooks/useConciergeAgent.ts` drives the Claude tool-use loop. The AI controls all stage transitions via an `advance_stage` tool — widgets never advance the stage directly.
- **Streaming:** `app/api/concierge-agent/route.ts` uses the Anthropic streaming SDK and writes SSE events to the client so responses appear token-by-token.
- **State persistence:** Onboarding state is saved to the server on every stage change (`app/api/onboarding-state/route.ts`) with optimistic locking. `localStorage` provides a fast in-memory fallback.
- **Configuration application:** `lib/api/concierge-backend.ts` calls MCP tools to create users, departments, ring groups, call queues, schedules, welcome menus, and after-hours routing.
- **CDR analysis:** `app/api/analyze-cdr/route.ts` sends the uploaded CSV to `claude-sonnet-4-6` and returns structured JSON (agents, numbers, queues, insights, recommendations) that pre-populates later stages.
- **Stage guards:** `lib/utils/stage-guards.ts` prevents the AI from advancing a stage until all required fields are collected.
- **Retry logic:** `lib/utils/retry.ts` wraps all MCP calls with exponential backoff.
- **Conversation truncation:** `lib/utils/truncate-messages.ts` keeps the message history within Claude's context window.
- **Analytics:** `lib/utils/analytics.ts` tracks flow events. Wire a real destination (PostHog, Segment, custom webhook) with one call to `setAnalyticsDestination(fn)`.
- **Locale-aware AI:** The active locale is sent with every request to `/api/concierge-agent`; the system prompt instructs Claude to respond in the user's language.

### Widget Files

Each onboarding stage has its own component under `components/concierge/widgets/`:

## Welcome Landing Page (`/welcome`)

New accounts receive an email with a link to **`https://n2psettings.vercel.app/welcome`** after purchasing. This is the first touchpoint with the product.

### User flow

```
Email link → /welcome
  → (if not signed in) /login?returnUrl=/welcome → /welcome
  → User clicks "Start Setup"
  → Concierge overlay opens (welcome mode)
  → Onboarding flow (8 stages)
  → Flow complete → /ucass/onboarding (settings hub)
```

### Page design

- **Net2phone branded** — pastel blue→violet→pink gradient background, `Plus_Jakarta_Sans` typeface, gradient-accent CTA button
- **"Account confirmed" pill** — green checkmark signals the paid account is ready
- **Headline:** *"Let's get your phone system live."*
- **Steps card** — briefly explains what the assistant will do (learn business info → set up team/routing → activate)
- **Language selector** — globe icon + locale code in the top-right header; sets `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie and reloads; supports EN / ES / PT-BR / FR-CA
- **No auto-open** — assistant only opens when the user clicks "Start Setup"

### Concierge welcome mode

When the overlay is open on `/welcome`, it switches to a wider, more polished shell:

| Feature | Default (dashboard) | Welcome mode |
|---|---|---|
| Panel width | `max-w-2xl` | `max-w-3xl` |
| Header | Blue icon + title | Gradient avatar + gradient hairline |
| Backdrop | Click to dismiss | Non-dismissible (pointer-events-none) |
| Progress bar | Solid blue | Blue→violet→fuchsia gradient |
| Done CTA | "Close" | "Open Settings & continue →" → `/ucass/onboarding` |

### Key files

```
app/welcome/
├── page.tsx          # Landing UI — headline, steps card, CTA
├── layout.tsx        # Metadata (title/description)
└── WelcomeShell.tsx  # Auth gate + AssistantProvider + ConciergeProvider

components/welcome/
└── WelcomeAgentAvatar.tsx   # SVG agent mark (slate + blue gradient)
```

## Internationalization (i18n)

The app ships with full multi-language support powered by [`next-intl`](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/).

### Supported Locales

| Locale | Language | Market |
|---|---|---|
| `en` | English | USA, global (default) |
| `es` | Spanish | CALA (Latin America) |
| `fr-CA` | French (Canadian) | Canada |
| `pt-BR` | Portuguese (Brazilian) | Brazil |

### How It Works

**Locale detection order:**
1. `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie — set when the user picks a language from the selector
2. Browser `Accept-Language` header
3. Default locale (`en`)

**Routing strategy:** `"never"` prefix — locale is determined solely by cookie or `Accept-Language` header; URLs are **never** rewritten with a locale segment. All routes remain at their canonical paths (`/ucass/...`) for every language. This avoids 404s that would otherwise occur if the middleware redirected to `/es/ucass/...` paths that have no corresponding pages in the app directory.

**Key files:**

```
i18n/
├── config.ts       # Locale list, default locale, lang tags
├── request.ts      # Server-side getRequestConfig (loads messages per locale)
└── routing.ts      # defineRouting with localePrefix: "never"

messages/
├── en.json         # English (base / source of truth)
├── es.json         # Spanish
├── fr-CA.json      # French Canadian
└── pt-BR.json      # Brazilian Portuguese

middleware.ts       # next-intl middleware (locale detection + URL rewriting)
contexts/LocaleContext.tsx   # Client-side locale state + setLocale() helper
components/ui/LocaleSelector.tsx  # Globe icon dropdown in the TopBar
```

**String coverage:** All message files include translations for:
- Common UI primitives (`common.*`)
- Auth / login page (`login.*`, `auth.*`)
- Top navigation groups and items (`nav.*`)
- TopBar controls (`topbar.*`)
- The full Concierge agent UI — all 8 stages, all widget labels, error messages, placeholders (`concierge.*`)
- Welcome landing page (`welcomeLanding.*`)
- Sidekick / N2P Assistant (`assistant.*`)
- Schedules, Ring Groups, Team Members sections
- Error boundary and error pages (`errors.*`)
- Language picker labels (`locale.*`)

**Adding a new locale:**
1. Add the locale code to `i18n/config.ts` → `locales` array.
2. Create `messages/<locale>.json` (copy `en.json` as a base).
3. That's it — the middleware, routing, and `LocaleSelector` pick it up automatically.

**AI language support:** The user's active locale is forwarded to `/api/concierge-agent` with every request. The system prompt instructs Claude to respond **only** in that language, so the entire onboarding conversation (including AI-generated summaries, tables, and confirmations) matches the user's selected language.

## API Routes

| Route | Method(s) | Auth required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/concierge-agent` | POST | Yes | SSE-streaming Claude agent; drives the onboarding conversation |
| `/api/analyze-cdr` | POST | Yes | CDR CSV → Claude analysis → structured JSON |
| `/api/research-website` | POST | No | Scrapes a website using Claude and extracts business info |
| `/api/n2p-tools` | POST | Yes | Executes any MCP tool against the net2phone backend |
| `/api/onboarding-state` | GET / PUT / DELETE | Yes | Server-side persistence for onboarding state (with optimistic locking) |
| `/api/porting` | GET / POST | Yes | Submit and track number porting requests |
| `/api/validate-user-email` | GET | Yes | Real-time email availability check against the account's team members |
| `/api/proxy/[...path]` | ALL | Forwarded | Proxies to `app.net2phone.com/api` |
| `/api/proxy-v2/[...path]` | ALL | Forwarded | Proxies to `app.net2phone.com/api/v2` |
| `/api/proxy-n2p/[...path]` | ALL | Forwarded | Proxies to `api.n2p.io/v2` |
| `/api/proxy-auth/[...path]` | ALL | Forwarded | Proxies to `auth.net2phone.com/api` |

---

## Proxy Architecture

The app proxies all net2phone API calls through Next.js server routes so credentials never leave the server and the browser only talks to the same origin.

```
Browser → /api/proxy/[...path]       → app.net2phone.com/api
Browser → /api/proxy-v2/[...path]    → app.net2phone.com/api/v2
Browser → /api/proxy-n2p/[...path]   → api.n2p.io/v2
Browser → /api/proxy-auth/[...path]  → auth.net2phone.com/api
```

All proxy routes validate path segments before forwarding (blocks `../` traversal and unsafe characters).

---

## MCP Server

`lib/mcp/server.ts` exposes 60+ net2phone API operations as MCP tools. The `lib/n2p-tools/adapter.ts` maps Anthropic tool calls to the correct MCP tool + argument shape.

**End users — connect Claude:** open **`/claude-mcp`** on your deployment (e.g. production `https://n2psettings.vercel.app/claude-mcp`) for step-by-step instructions and the exact MCP base URL for this environment.

**HTTP endpoint:** `GET/POST /api/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, stateless). Unauthenticated calls return **401** with `WWW-Authenticate` pointing at **`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`**, which lists **`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`** so MCP clients can run the paste-token OAuth flow (`/api/oauth/authorize` → `/api/oauth/token`).

**Auth shortcuts (same handler):**

- `Authorization: Bearer …` — access JWT (`eyJ…`) or opaque refresh token (exchanged automatically).
- Query: `?token=eyJ…` (access JWT), `?refreshToken=…` (opaque refresh; if someone pastes a JWT here by mistake, it is used as the access token instead of calling the refresh grant).
- Query or headers: `accountId` / `X-Account-Id` (recommended if the JWT lacks `aid`).

Available tool categories:
- Team members — create, search, update, assign phone
- Departments — create, list, assign members
- Ring groups — create, update, add members, set schedule
- Call queues — create, update, add agents
- Schedules — create, add time blocks, load holidays
- Virtual assistant — create/update, set menu options, TTS greeting
- Phone numbers — list, assign
- Users — get next extension
- Devices — list, assign
- Licenses — check eligibility

**Claude Desktop** often requires a stdio bridge (`npx mcp-remote …`) with **Node.js 20+**; see **`/claude-mcp`** and `n2p-mcp/README.md` for copy-paste config. Local stdio (`n2p-mcp/dist`) is optional for developers.

---

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.9.0+ (required by Next.js 16; use `nvm use 20` if you have nvm)
- An active net2phone account with admin access
- Anthropic API key (for the Concierge and CDR analysis)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Create environment file
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in the required values (see Environment Variables below)

# 3. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Login:** Paste your OAuth2 refresh token on the login page. Obtain it from [app.net2phone.com](https://app.net2phone.com): DevTools → Application → Local Storage → `n2p_refresh_token`.

**Testing the welcome flow:** Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/welcome`. If not signed in you'll be redirected to `/login?returnUrl=/welcome`, then back to the landing. Click "Start Setup" to open the onboarding assistant.

> If you get `invalid_grant`, the token may be expired. Log back in at app.net2phone.com and copy a fresh `n2p_refresh_token`.

### Changing the UI language locally

The language picker (globe icon in the top bar) switches the locale at runtime and sets a `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie — no URL change occurs. To test a specific locale without the UI, set the cookie directly in DevTools → Application → Cookies → `NEXT_LOCALE` (values: `en`, `es`, `fr-CA`, `pt-BR`), then reload.

---

## Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` with the following:

```bash
# ── Required ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Anthropic API key — used by the Concierge agent and CDR analyzer
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# ── net2phone API base URLs (defaults point to production) ────────────────────

N2P_API_URL=https://app.net2phone.com/
N2P_API_V2_URL=https://app.net2phone.com/api/v2
N2P_API_AUTH_URL=https://auth.net2phone.com
N2P_API_N2P_URL=https://api.n2p.io/v2

# ── Optional ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# AI Music-on-Hold (ElevenLabs) — Music Options & Call Queue hold music
# N2P_API_ELEVEN_LABS=your_elevenlabs_api_key
# BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=... (Vercel Blob — for call-queue hold music URLs)

N2P_AI_AGENT_URL=https://agent.net2phone.com
N2P_COACH_URL=https://coachai.net2phone.com
```

> **Production (Vercel):** Set these in the Vercel dashboard under **Project → Settings → Environment Variables**. After changing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, redeploy for the change to take effect.

---

## Deployment (Vercel)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

The project is a Next.js 16 App Router app and deploys to Vercel with zero configuration.

**Important note on onboarding state storage:** `app/api/onboarding-state/route.ts` currently writes to `os.tmpdir()`, which is ephemeral on Vercel's serverless platform. For production multi-user deployments, replace the file-based store with **Vercel KV** (Redis). The GET/PUT/DELETE handler interface is self-contained and is a simple swap.

**Node.js version:** Set the Node.js version to **20.x** in Vercel → Project Settings → General → Node.js Version. The `engines` field in `package.json` and `.nvmrc` both pin `>=20.9.0`.

---

## Security

The following security controls are in place:

### HTTP Headers (`next.config.mjs`)
- `Content-Security-Policy` — restricts scripts, styles, connects, and frame-ancestors
- `Strict-Transport-Security` — enforces HTTPS for 1 year including subdomains
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` — prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — blocks MIME sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` — disables camera, microphone, geolocation, payment

### Authentication
- All AI-calling routes (`/api/concierge-agent`, `/api/analyze-cdr`, `/api/n2p-tools`, etc.) require a valid `Bearer` token
- JWT claims are decoded server-side via `lib/server/jwt.ts` — no client-visible secrets

### SSRF Protection
- `lib/server/ssrf-guard.ts` — blocks private IP ranges, loopback, AWS/GCP metadata endpoints, and non-HTTP schemes before any server-side fetch of a user-supplied URL
- Applied to `/api/research-website` and `/api/generate-moh`
- `/api/generate-moh` additionally enforces an **explicit domain allowlist** — only `*.blob.vercel-storage.com` URLs are accepted; all other domains are rejected before `fetch` is called

### Proxy Path Validation
- `lib/server/proxy-guard.ts` — rejects path traversal sequences (`../`) and unsafe characters in all 4 proxy routes

### Rate Limiting
- In-memory sliding-window rate limiter (`lib/server/rate-limit.ts`) applied per client IP:
  - `concierge-agent` — 30 requests / minute
  - `analyze-cdr` — 10 requests / minute
  - `research-website` — 20 requests / minute
- For multi-instance production deployments, replace the in-memory store with **Upstash Redis** (`@upstash/ratelimit`) — a drop-in swap

### Input Validation
- `lib/utils/validation.ts` — validates emails, phone numbers, MAC addresses, URLs, user objects, porting provider/address
- `concierge-agent` route enforces a 200-message cap and 2 MB body size limit
- `analyze-cdr` route enforces a 5 MB body size limit
- CDR content is truncated to 40,000 characters before being sent to the AI

### XSS Prevention
- AI-generated markdown in `components/calls/AnalyzeModal.tsx` is rendered via a pure React `renderBold()` helper — `**bold**` markers are converted to `<strong>` React nodes; `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is not used anywhere in the call analysis UI

### Concurrency
- `onboarding-state` writes use an optimistic locking scheme (`clientVersion` timestamp comparison) and atomic file rename to prevent partial writes and stale overwrites

---

## Known Limitations

| Area | Limitation |
|---|---|
| Onboarding state | Stored in `os.tmpdir()` — ephemeral on Vercel; swap to Vercel KV for production |
| Rate limiting | In-memory per-instance — does not share counts across Vercel function instances; swap to Upstash Redis |
| Analytics | Events are collected locally and logged to console; wire `setAnalyticsDestination()` to PostHog or Segment |
| CDR file size | Truncated to 40,000 characters (~800 rows) before AI analysis |
| Porting LOA | Sign URL is provided by the net2phone API; the signing flow is external |
| Onboarding legacy route | `/api/onboarding-agent` is a non-streaming legacy route; `/api/concierge-agent` is the active route |
| i18n — AI content | Claude's responses are language-instructed via system prompt; output quality depends on Claude's multilingual capability for edge-case phrasing |
| i18n — date/time | Dates and times are formatted in English regardless of locale; full `Intl.DateTimeFormat` integration is a future improvement |
| i18n — phone validation | Phone number regex is generic; `libphonenumber-js` per-locale validation is a future improvement |
